# Sort Algorithms

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.

# Algorithms Implementation 
**Buble Sort**

> **Bubble sort**, sometimes referred to as **sinking sort**, is a simple [sorting
> algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm "Sorting
> algorithm") that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent
> elements and
> [swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_(computer_science) "Swap
> (computer science)") them if they are in the wrong order. The pass
> through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm,
> which is a [comparison
> sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort "Comparison
> sort"), is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to
> the top of the list.
